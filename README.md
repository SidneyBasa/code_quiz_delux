# code_quiz_delux
A webpage with a quiz of 8 questions that is timed from 75 seconds, highest scores are saved.

## Description
The website is able to load questions and answers.
The questions and answers are able to be changed when the user interacts with the answers button.
But this is where the functionality ceases, as I have not implemented the high scores in the local storage, nor have I tallied the total score.

I was able to work on this challenge for a total of 8 hours.
The syntax in JavaScript to interact with elements of an HTML page were studied and practiced in the days leading up to to this assignment.
This challenge has shown me that I require more JavaScript, HTML and CSS practice.
