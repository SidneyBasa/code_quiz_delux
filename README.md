# code_quiz_delux
A webpage with a quiz of 8 questions that is timed from 75 seconds, highest scores are saved.
I was able to work on this challenge for a total of 8 hours.
The syntax in JavaScript to interact with elements of an HTML page were studied and practiced in the days leading up to to this assignment.
This challenge has shown me that I require more JavaScript, HTML and CSS practice.
